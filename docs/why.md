<h2> Why Shimmer? </h2>
I'm a big fan of Brian Eno & Dan Lanois' work, and have continued to find combinations of pitch shifting & feedback loops continue to produce artistically satisfying results, particularly in a real time environment, and while I have plenty of plugins at my disposal that implement this with delay lines, my collection of shimmer reverbs, particulars those aimed at more abstract sound design is lacking, so to create the effects I'm after I often have to string together several plugins together, with a send & receive loop between audio devices to bypass feedback control in DAWs like Reaper. Shimmer reverb is also something I had played around with building in VCV Rack for slightly more stable real time use, so I already had a good idea of the signal path going in, and just really had the challenge of implementing this with STK, which I am still relatively new to.

<h2> Why Bandpass Filters? </h2>
During the creation process of my work Feedback Cycles, I had experimented with using filtered feedback signals with the  <a href="http://www.doepfer.de/a100_man/A199_man.pdf"> Doepfer A-199 Spring Reverb module </a> and was incredible pleased with the result, but felt limited after awhile with using just one filter. While working on how to expand the initial shimmer algorithm I was reminded of this process by a video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp7DKJaQs9o"> Hainbach </a> about using filters with analog mixing boards to create resonant feedback, and wanted to try bringing this into the digital text based realm.

<h2> Why these Reverb Algorithms? </h2>
This started as a reverb focused for use with the synthesizers and still is largely focused on this, so my first choice was the JCRev, based on Chowning's focus on FM synthesis. I noted that both the NRev & PCRev both use the same syntax as the JCRev, so implementing them into the script was pretty easy.
